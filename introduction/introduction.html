            <h2>Several Important Points</h2>
            <p class="point-title font-weight-bold text-uppercase">Central aim of Art History</p>
            <p>A central aim of art history is to determine the original context of artworks.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="point-title font-weight-bold text-uppercase">Art historians' target</p>
            <p>Art historians seek to achieve a full understanding not only of why these “persisting events” of human
                history look the way they do but also of why the artistic events happened at all.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="point-title font-weight-bold text-uppercase">Relationship between Art History and History</p>
            <p>The study of history is therefore vital to art history. And art history is often very important to the study of history.</p>

            <h2>ART HISTORY IN THE 21ST CENTURY</h2>
            <p class="point-title font-weight-bold">Classification</p>
            <p>  Scholars traditionally have classified such works as <span class="font-weight-bold">architecture</span>,
                <span class="font-weight-bold">sculpture</span>,
                the <span class="font-weight-bold">pictorial arts</span>
                (painting, drawing, printmaking,and photography),and the
                <span class="font-weight-bold">craft arts</span>, or arts of design.
            </p>
            <p>The craft arts comprise utilitarian objects, such as
                <span class="font-italic font-weight-light">ceramics</span>,
                <span class="font-italic font-weight-light">metal- work</span>,
                <span class="font-italic font-weight-light">textiles</span>,
                <span class="font-italic font-weight-light">jewelry</span>, and
                <span class="font-italic font-weight-light">similar accessories of ordinary living</span>.
                Artists of every age have blurred the boundaries among these categories, but this is especially
                true today,when multimedia works abound.</p>

            <h4>THE QUESTIONS ART HISTORIANS ASK</h4>
            <ol>
                <li class="list-title font-weight-bold">HOW OLD IS IT?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="list-subtitle">Chronology</li>
                    <p>An indispensable subject of art historical inquiry is chronology, the dating of art objects and buildings. </p>

                    <li class="list-subtitle">Physical Evidence</li>
                    <p>Physical evidence often
                        <span class="font-weight-bold">reliably indicates an object’s age</span>
                    </p>

                    <li class="list-subtitle">Documentary Evidence</li>
                    <p>Documentary evidence can help pinpoint the date of an object or building when
                        a dated written document mentions the work.</p>

                    <li class="list-subtitle">Internal Evidence</li>
                    <p>A painter might have depicted an identifiable person or a kind of
                        hairstyle,clothing,or furniture fashionable only at a certain time.</p>

                    <li class="list-subtitle">Stylistic Evidence</li>
                    <p>Stylistic evidence is also very important.The analysis of style—an artist’s distinctive manner of
                        producing an object — is the art historian’s special sphere. Unfortunately, because it is a subjective assessment,
                        <span class="font-weight-bold">stylistic evidence is by far the most unreliable chronological criterion.</span>
                    </p>
                </ul>

                <li class="list-title font-weight-bold">WHAT IS ITS STYLE</li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="list-subtitle">Period Style</li>
                    <p>Period style refers to
                        <span class="font-weight-bold">the characteristic artistic manner of a specific time,
                        usually within a distinct culture</span>,
                        such as “Archaic Greek” or “Late Byzantine.”</p>

                    <li class="list-subtitle">Regional Style</li>
                    <p>Regional style is the term art historians use to describe variations in style tied to geography.
                        Like an object’s date, its provenance, or place of origin, can significantly determine its character.
                        Very often two artworks from the same place made centuries apart are more similar than contemporaneous works
                        from two different regions.</p>

                    <p>Personal style, the distinctive manner of individual artists or architects,
                        often decisively explains stylistic discrepancies among monuments of the same time and place.</p>

                <li class="list-title font-weight-bold">WHAT IS ITS SUBJECT?</li>
                <p>Art historians traditionally separate pictorial subjects into various categories,
                such as religious, historical,mythological,genre (daily life),portraiture, landscape (a depiction of a place),
                    still life (an arrangement of inanimate objects), and their numerous subdivisions and combinations.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="list-subtitle">Icongraphy</li>
                    <p>Iconography—literally, the “writing of images”—refers both to the content, or subject of an artwork,and to the study of content in art.
                    By extension, it also includes the study of symbols, images that stand for other images or encapsulate ideas.</p>
                    <li class="list-subtitle">Personification</li>
                    <p>Throughout the history of art,artists have used personifications—abstract ideas codified in human form. </p>
                </ul>
